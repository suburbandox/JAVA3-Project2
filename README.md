# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-181 Java III course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Chapters 1 and 2
In the first chapter, the text author reviewed the history of Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. They went over the earl versions and described how the Enterprise Edition branched off from the Standard Edition. It is important to have a good understanding of JAVA SE to become a good JAVA EE coder.  The chapter introduced Servlets (a Java class that is responsible for accepting and responding to HTTP requests), Listeners (which notify code of events), and JSPs (which help to create graphical user interfaces for web applications. It went over the directory structure and other aspects of JAVA architecture.

Chapter 2 introduces JAVA EE application servers and Web Containers and describes their use. It went over how to install Tomcat on my home computer and discussed how to debug Tomcat from IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.
